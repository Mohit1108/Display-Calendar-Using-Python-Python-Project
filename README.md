# Display-Calendar-Using-Python-Python-Project
The calendar module allows the output of calendars as the program and provides additional useful functions related to the calendar. The functions and classes defined in the Calendar module use an idealized calendar, the current Gregorian calendar extended indefinitely in both directions. By default, these calendars have Monday as the first day of the week and Sunday as the last (the European convention).
